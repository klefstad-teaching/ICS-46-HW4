## Local GTests
To install GTests on your hub instances and enable local test development, run:
```sudo apt-get install -y libgtest-dev libgmock-dev```

## Submit to Gradescope

Each homework submission will follow the same general pattern and should always have the
following folder structure:

```bash
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── gtest
│   └── <CLASSNAME>_gtests.cpp
└── src
    ├── main.cpp
    ├── <CLASSNAME>.cpp
    └── <CLASSNAME>.h
```

All submissions are done on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).

On Gradescope, go into your Account Settings, and link your GitHub account to Gradescope.

Then on the course Gradescope, go to the **Homework 4** assignment, press the Submit button, choose the GitHub option, and select your project and branch.
